TTC aka Tanktrouble Classic (extension edition) is an extension which seeks to reconstruct the visual aesthetic of [TankTrouble Classic](https://classic.tanktrouble.com) â€” to bring the old to the new.

## What does the extension bring?

TTC extension is the based on the [Classic TankTrouble](https://classic.tanktrouble.com/), very first version of this beautiful game called [TankTrouble](https://tanktrouble.com/). As the time passed TankTrouble improved alot. Each update brought something new to it. As the uptades were happening, Classic TankTrouble got completely replaced. Fear of losing it forever. I have made something that will try to bring the old TankTrouble graphics back to life as much as possible, I have made this extension.
