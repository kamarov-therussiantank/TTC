TTCV2 is a Chrome extension which seeks to reconstruct the visual aesthetic of [TankTrouble Classic](https://classic.tanktrouble.com) â€” to bring the old to the new.

## What does the add-on bring?

TTCV2 extension is the based on the [Classic TankTrouble](https://classic.tanktrouble.com/), very first version of this beautiful game called [TankTrouble](https://tanktrouble.com/). As the time passed TankTrouble improved alot. Each upgrade brought something new to it. As the upgrades were happening, Classic TankTrouble got completely replaced. Fear of losing it forever. I have made TTCV2 to bring back that nostalgic game back to life. Injected in like a virus to a current game version [TankTrouble Online](https://tanktrouble.com/)
